Download MSCOCO2017 train/val/test images from [[data](https://cocodataset.org/#download)], and save the images of each subset into the corresponding folders[train2017, test2017, val2017].

Ensure that the final directory structure under 'images' is as follows:
```  
${ROOT}  
|-- data 
|
|   |-- MSCOCO  
|   |   |-- images  
|   |   |   |-- train2017  
|   |   |   |-- val2017
|   |   |   |-- test2017  
```
